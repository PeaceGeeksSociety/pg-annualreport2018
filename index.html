	   				<p class="lead animate-this">PeaceGeeks builds digital tools to empower communities in the pursuit of peace.</p>	

	   				<p class="animate-this">As Chairman of the Board of Directors, it is my privilege to lead PeaceGeeks to deliver positive impacts to the communities we serve. In 2018, we welcomed three new Board Members to our ranks, from the accounting, project management, and digital security sectors. We are now more confident than ever before in our diverse and well-balanced Board, and are looking to expand further in 2019 as PeaceGeeks continues to grow and develop.<br><br>

	   				Our Board of Directors consistently strives to improve PeaceGeeks’ Governance policies and model, based on the core values of transparency, accountability, and sustainability. In 2018 we strengthened both our financial reporting practices and our project capacities by bringing on key staff members. New staff members contributed to a restructuring of project management roles so we could delve deeper into our current projects and plan proactively for the future of our permanent programs. We also extended our hands for assistance in areas where we felt we needed expert input: to this end we contracted financial professionals to look after our routine accounting and funder reporting.<br><br>

	   				We enhanced our key messaging platforms and materials in 2018 by initiating a thorough review of past materials, a consolidation of those materials, and a refresh for the present and future of the organization. This undertaking will continue through the first few months of 2019, and coincide with the development of a long-term strategic plan to guide PeaceGeeks through the end of its first decade and into its teenage years.<br><br>

					We are excited to have brought to our ranks a full time Fund Development Manager, so we can begin focusing on improving the state of our core funding and ensuring our longevity, and the sustainability of our programs.
					<br><br>

					2019 is shaping up to be another pivotal year for us at PeaceGeeks. From the ground up, we are continuing to refine and develop our practices, principles, and programs to best serve at-risk communities here at home in Vancouver, across Canada, and around the globe. <br><br>
					

					I am constantly moved by our small-but-mighty staff, our incredible Board of Directors, our dedicated and passionate volunteers, and all those who devote their time, skills, and resources at many and various levels to PeaceGeeks. 
					</p>


	   				<p class="animate-this nomarginbottom">I hope you too will be inspired to join or support us in 2019!<br><br>

	   				Sincerely,<br><span class="lead">Simon Canning</span></p>

	   				<p class="lead animate-this">2018 was another year of unprecedented growth for PeaceGeeks.</p>	

	   				<p class="animate-this nomarginbottom">After we won the Google.org Impact Challenge funding in 2017, we set to work building a groundbreaking mobile app that would tangibly assist all newcomers to Canada - immigrants and refugees alike - by connecting them with a user-friendly directory of important services and relevant information to ease their settlement journey. To this end, the app will be available in seven languages, does not require personal information or a login profile, is useable offline and compatible with in-phone mapping applications. Arrival Advisor is set to launch in March 2019 across Metro Vancouver and throughout British Columbia. We hope to scale the app across Canada, and are currently seeking cooperation and support for that phase of the project.<br><br>

	   				Approaching the end of its second year in operation, our Meshkat Community Project in Jordan is reaching more people and communities. Between April and December, we hosted nearly 1,300 workshop participants to strengthen community capacity, build social cohesion, and respond proactively to extremism in online spaces. We hosted our first annual Peace Award ceremony, honouring artists and individuals who promote positive narratives of peace or social justice through their work, and we are continuing to build a sustainable foundation for Meshkat programming in Jordan with the intention to continue beyond 2020.<br><br>

	   				We were fortunate to receive new and vital funding support from the Government of British Columbia, and Immigration, Refugees, &amp; Citizenship Canada, that will go a long way toward funding our Canada-based programs through 2021.<br><br>

	   				Our team has grown from two full-time staff to 14 in under two years. We have built a phenomenal team that is focused on ensuring we make a positive and sustainable impact on the communities we serve around the world.<br><br>

					None of our accomplishments would be possible without the incredible support from our donors, volunteers, and community partners. We thank you all for your ongoing belief in our mission to build digital tools and empower communities to strive for peace.<br><br> 

					2019 will be a defining year for us. As we launch Arrival Advisor in British Columbia and further develop Meshkat in Jordan, we will have a better sense for what we are doing well, and where we have opportunities to strengthen our impact, scale our projects, and expand our horizons. We will be inviting an external evaluator to constructively assess our projects on the ground, and help us develop and implement a five-year strategic plan by the end of 2019. I will travel to Jordan to celebrate PeaceGeeks’ second annual Peace Awards. PeaceGeeks will present at the National Metropolis Conference in Halifax on the intersecting themes of technology and innovation in the Canadian settlement sector. We hope also to present at the International Metropolis Conference in Ottawa in June. <br><br>

					As with any not-for-profit organization, going through a period of growth and transition as we experienced in 2018 is not without its challenges. We are committed to understanding what we are doing well and where there is a need for reflection as we seek to strengthen our foundation going forward.<br><br>

   					<p class="animate-this" data-animate="fadeInLeft">Leveraging our knowledge and experience from our partnership with the UNHCR to build Services Advisor in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) Region, we spent all of 2018 feverishly building its Canadian counterpart: <em><a href="https://arrivaladvisor.ca">Arrival Advisor</a></em>. <em>Arrival Advisor</em> is a free mobile application designed specifically for newcomers to Canada that offers them a comprehensive directory of services and information to help ease their settlement journey.<br><br>

   					PeaceGeeks worked closely  with newcomers, local immigration partnerships (LIPs), and frontline settlement sector workers to develop a practical and sustainable tool that will serve individuals and families across British Columbia.<br><br>

   					<em>Arrival Advisor</em> will help the more than 153,000 immigrants and refugees living in BC to find out how to register to healthcare, enroll in English courses or further education, learn about tennant’s rights and immigration procedures, register their children in school, and so much more. Arrival Advisor will be available in English, French, and Arabic to start, with Chinese, Tagalog, Punjabi, and Korean to follow. Arrival Advisor’s information is saved to a user’s phone so they can use it offline, and it syncs to their Maps so they can navigate their way to services. </p>

   				</div>

   				<div class="col-six text-part">   				
   					
   					<p class="animate-this rightside" data-animate="fadeInLeft">

   					<em>Arrival Advisor</em> is also completely anonymous. Users can fill out a short questionnaire about their circumstances to streamline the amount of information available on the app and then bookmark their most relevant topics, but they do not need to offer any personal information or create a profile to do so. PeaceGeeks is passionate about protecting data privacy. <br><br>

   					We were fortunate to receive additional funding from the Government of British Columbia to develop Arrival Advisor. Thanks to the support of the Province of British Columbia, Ministry of Jobs, Trade and Technology, and from the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/canada2017" target="_blank">Google.org Impact Challenge</a>, we are thrilled to be launching Arrival Advisor in March 2019, and are seeking opportunities to expand the app across Canada in the near future.<br><br>

The aim of <em>Meshkat Community</em> is to increase creative and peaceful citizen engagement in challenging hate, violence, extremism and polarization to reduce community vulnerability in the Middle East.<br><br>Current programs of <em>Meshkat Community</em> include Community Resilience and Capacity Building Workshops, an Artists-in-Residence Program and annual Peace Awards Contest, which are taking place in Amman, Karak, and Irbid. In 2018, the project will expand to other parts of Jordan including Ajloun, Aqaba, Salt, Ma’an, Tafieleh and Zarqa.</p>

							<h4>Launching SMS platform for International Criminal Court (ICC) in Uganda</h4>
							<p>PeaceGeeks developed and launched in April a free interactive SMS platform for the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int" target="_blank">International Criminal Court</a>. The SMS platform enables victims, communities affected by the crimes alleged in the case of Mr. Dominic Ongwen, and the general population of Uganda, to follow the proceedings before the Court. Mobile technology enhances and complements the work of the ICC, having the potential to reach a wide population with timely information. The platform is freely available to subscribers in three different languages: Acholi, Ateso and English. <a href="https://peacegeeks.org/partner/international-criminal-court" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>

	   				<p class="lead animate-this">PeaceGeeks builds digital tools to empower communities in the pursuit of peace.</p>	

	   				<p class="animate-this">Why is this important?<br><br>

	   				There is no doubt the world has had its share of troubles last year many of which will persist for the next few years. But the good news is we are doing meaningful and positive work such as:</p>

	   				<ol class="animate-this">
	   					<li>We are creating positive digital content in Arabic from our Jordan office, primarily supported by Canadian Government; messages and activities that foster inclusion and work for peace,</li>
	   					<li>We are empowering refugees and internally displaced persons in Jordan and Turkey as well as newcomers at home in Canada by providing digital access to services, supported by Google.org Canada,</li>
	   					<li>We are building our own capacity and resilience with improved staffing processes, new strategic relationships with organizations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency,  and improving our internal governance processes.</li>
	   				</ol>

	   				<p class="animate-this nomarginbottom">We are making a positive difference at the community level and I hope you will be inspired by some of our stories here in our 2017 Annual Report.<br><br>

	   				We have a volunteer board committed to providing the right level of governance for our growing organization. To that end, as incoming Chair I am committed to working towards a governance model that drives the highest levels of transparency and accountability.<br><br>

	   				In 2018 and 2019 we will continue to work on the above and will start working towards a new initiative around strengthening digital security and privacy for other not for profits. We also hope to engage a dynamic Community manager later in 2018 to lead and engage our many volunteers around the world.<br><br>

	   				As the incoming Chair in 2017 it has been my privilege to serve as a PeaceGeeks volunteer and hope you will find the inspiration to support our work as well.<br><br>

                  Way before tech for good had its own hashtag, PeaceGeeks was out in the world trying to figure out how to use tech to level the playing field for people living through the most harrowing conflicts and crises on the planet. Tech is the medium but it's humanity that shines through PeaceGeeks' work.</p>
